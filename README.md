There are several commercial solutions which allow embedding of calendars into my website.
I only have a link to an ICS file and want to show a nice-looking calendar on my site.
Browser-only calendars usually have the problem that many ICS files can not be
accessed (such as ownCloud/nextCloud in my case).
I also want to be in control over who knows the people who
visit the site and not pass everything to Google.
This is a solution in my case which I share with the world.
You are free to use it or deploy your own, modify or share it.
It works offline and in company networks, too.

Features
- Embedded calendar
- Choice of time zone
- ICS link, best multiple
- month/week as a view
- name, time of event, link?
- showing the time span
- styling of choice (icon, color, font, ...)
